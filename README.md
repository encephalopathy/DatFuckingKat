Premise:

You are an occultist, trying to complete a ritual to summon a spirit. Conditions are perfect, you’ve calculated and researched and now have the magic phrase to utter to summon forth a spirit from the nether realm.

**SUDDENLY YOUR FUCKING CAT SHOWS UP, YELPS AS THE SPIRIT BEGINS TO APPEAR! AND SENDS IT INTO A FLURRY!**

You must salvage this bad situation and utter a new magic phrase/ complete an improvised ritual in order to quell the spirit.

Dat mechanic: Anagrams on crack!

So The player is given a phrase. For example, one of those bullshit motivational quotes 

“ Every journey starts with a small step…"

**The fucking cat shows ups !**

and the player is now given a broken version of this phras

"Ever   journey y start s … small a step"

The player then has a limited amount of time to re organize the phrase into something grammatically correct! This will act as the new magical incantation

"A step starts every small journey…"
